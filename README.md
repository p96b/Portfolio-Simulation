# Portfolio-Simulation
Group Project - Simulation of an artificial portfolio: The user has a defined amount of money which he can invest and then he can choose how much of which stock he wants to buy and later he can also choose how much of his stocks he wants to sell again. So every time he opens the simulation he would have his actual portfolio as a starting point. Moreover he can see some graphs e.g. of the different stocks in his portfolio and an overview on how his portfolio/one stock in his portfolio changed over time.
